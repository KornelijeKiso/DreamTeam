3|Zimbabwe Tour|Easily the most important political site in Harare if not all of Zimbabwe, Heroes Acre is located about ten minutes from the city center. The main premise of the monument is fairly universal to colonized countries: to commemorate those who have sacrificed in the revolution. In this case, the war in question was the Rhodesian Bush War that lasted from 1964 to Zimbabwes independence in 1980. Additionally, those who are deemed by the current regime to have dedicated their lives to the country in a sufficient fashion are given a resting place. The monument was designed by North Korea in conjunction with Zimbabwean architects, with construction starting in 1981.|English|15|Harare Center|Lion and Cheetah Park, Raintree Venue,National Heroes Acre|Ngoma Kurira|8|https://medisf.traasgpu.com/ifis/0e2155f0ed1a300b-1024x576.jpg, https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_0.3173%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1954%2C$x_0%2C$y_140/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/6628cdfb7d36e66e8849d494e475ddda38812369, https://www.victoriafalls-guide.net/images/hwange-elephants-3.jpg|z|4
